gtk3-nocsd is a small module used to disable the client side decoration of gtk+ 3.

Introduction:
Since gtk+ 3.10, its developers added a so-called header bar or custom title bar.
With this and the client-side decoration, the original title bar and window border
provided by the window manager are disabled by gtk+. This makes all gtk+ 3 programs
look like align. Even worse, this may break some window manager or compositors.

Unfortunately, the gtk+ developers decided to be against the 
existing standards and provide "no option" to turn it off.

Luckily, with gtk3-nocsd, we still have a way to (partially) turn it off.

How to use:

1. build the code with the script. (you need pkg-config and gtk+3-dev packages)
> ./build.sh
After this you'll have a "gtk3-nocsd.so" file.

2. export some environment variables in your .profile or .bashrc.
> export GTK_CSD=0
> export LD_PRELOAD=<"full path" of your gtk3-nocsd.so file>

3. Re-login to make the environment variables take effect.

4. Hooray! GTK+ 3 client-side decoration is dead now.

How it work:

I use $LD_PRELOAD to override several gdk and glib/gobject APIs to
intercept related calls gtk+ 3 uses to setup CSD.
While gtk+ 3 is trying to initialize CSD, I let it think that there
is no compositor available, so CSD fail to start.
Actually, we never disable X compositing, so other parts are not affected.
This hack to my knowledge is the most specific way to disable CSD
without obvious side effects.
